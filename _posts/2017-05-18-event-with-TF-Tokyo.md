Good news Everybody!

The ML Kitchen and Tensorflow Tokyo groups are joining forces to gather a lot of smart, interesting people doing Deep Learning in Tokyo in one room and provide them awesome food and drinks. This is the perfect chance to do some networking with your peers, practice some transfer learning and go deeper into machine learning topics with interesting talks.

Tensorflow keeps showing up in media and research papers. Need to translate some kanji? There's a Tensorflow model for that! Judging your lunch photo? Turn Monet into Picasso and back? There's a Tensorflow model for that too. But it has a steep learning curve. How to turn photos into tensors? How to make a simple model? How to run a model someone else made? You don't need a PhD in Deep Learning to get started, but you could use some exchange with people who have already gone through this.

Have we mentioned awesome Cookpad-cooked food and drinks?
