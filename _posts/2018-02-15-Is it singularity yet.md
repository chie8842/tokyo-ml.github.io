Whether you're working on machine learning during the day or in your free time, take this opportunity to meet other researchers and engineers. Good chance to converge, add some noise to your neurons, network with your peers, get some knowledge transfer and go deeper into machine learning topics with interesting talks.

Wait... a Machine Learning event at Cookpad? The famous recipe sharing service company? What does machine learning have to do with cooking?

機械学習を業務に or 余暇に扱っている方は、ML Kitchen で是非他の研究者・エンジニアと交流しましょう！ML Kitchen は多くの ML 関係者が集い、刺激を受け、友達を増やし、知識を増やし、機械学習に関する話題を深く理解するチャンスです。

クックパッドで機械学習...？レシピで有名な会社では？機械学習と料理って関係あるの？
