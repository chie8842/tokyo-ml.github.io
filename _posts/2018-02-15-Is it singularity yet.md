title: Take over the world, with ML.
---

Whether you're working on machine learning during the day or in your free time, take this opportunity to meet other researchers and engineers. Good chance to converge, add some noise to your neurons, network with your peers, get some knowledge transfer and go deeper into machine learning topics with interesting talks.

Machine Learning is taking over the world, one research engineer at a time.
